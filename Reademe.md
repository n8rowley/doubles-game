# Doubles Game

A command-line score card for a family favorite game

## Rules of the game

### Players

Any--and I mean ANY--number of players can play together.

Most ages enjoy being a part of the action. Young children will have the most fun if they have a grasp on addition and some sense of risk and reward

### Time

The default number of rounds is set to 10 which usually requires around half an hour. The number of rounds can be decreased for a quicker or practice game. Additionally, the game has a built in feature that allows the players to specify a range of rounds and the end of the game will be selected randomly from within the range

### Setup

Atleast 1 pair of 6-sided dice is required. This will be rolled by each player once and passed around. Some groups prefer having a pair of *lucky* dice per person and only 1 pair is rolled at a time.

### Rules

A round starts by choosing a player to roll the dice. The resulting sum of their dice roll will be added to a running total. The next person rolls their dice and the sum is added to the total. There is 1 total being added to by all players, no one has their own total. 

**Example** player 1 rolls a 5 on one dye and a 3 on the other. The sum of the two rolls (8) is added to the total and the new total is 8. Player 2 rolls a 2 and a 1. The sume of the two rolls (3) is added to the running total which becomes 11. and so on.

#### Special rolls

**Doubles:** Any time two of the same number are rolled, all players will--unaviodably--exclaim "DOUBLES" and the running total is doubled. If doubles are rolled on the first roll, a special amount is added to the total. The special amount is calculated by taking the value on one of the dice and multiplying by 100

**Example** player 1 rolls two 3's. All players--unaviodably--exclaim "DOUBLES", and the total is increased to 300

**7's:** These are the crux of the round and can be the cause of a round coming to an end. A seven is rolled any time the sum of the two dice add to 7. The number of 7's that have been rolled in the round will be kept track of. When a seven is rolled, the score is increased by 75 and the 7's count increases by 1. On the fourth 7, the round is over and the running total is instantly set to 0.

#### Scoring Points
Scoring individual points happens by the cash-out mechanism. At any time before four 7's have been rolled (though there's no use cashing out before 3 becuase there's no added risk) a player may choose to cash-out. This must happen in between rolls and before a fourth 7 is rolled. Once three 7's have been rolled, play should slow down to allow players to cash-out. When a player cash's out, the running total at that moment is added to the players personal score. They then cannot score any more points this round. The round continues until all players have cashed out or a fourth 7 is rolled. If a fourth 7 is rolled, any player who hasn't cashed out for the round losses the opportunity.

***Example*** The round total is 325 and two 7's have been rolled. player 3 rolls a 3 and a 4. The running total is now 400 and three 7's have been rolled. Player 3 decides to cash out. player 4 rolls a 5 and a 5. the score is now 800. Player 1 decides to cash out. Player 5 rolls a 1 and a 1. The score is now 1600. Player 5 rolls a 6 and a 1. The round is immediately over. Scores after the round
- player 1: 800
- player 3: 400
- player 2: 0
- player 4: 0
- player 5: 0

A new round then begins with each player able to cash out

The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.
